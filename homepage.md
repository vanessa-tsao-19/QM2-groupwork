Vanessa: I’m a 2nd year BASc student majoring in Societies and I’m interested in economics and sustainability, in topics ranging from circular economies to sustainable energy. I enjoy writing for Pi Media and dancing (urban and jazz) in my free time. 

Mary: 
Hey, I’m Mary and I’m majoring in Sciences and Engineering. I love popular culture, communication and art, and when I’m not writing articles for Sci-Fi and Fantasy society’s blog, I moonlight as a computer science and Russian language student. I’d love to explore data journalism once I leave university!

Zewei:
Hi! I major in Sciences and Engineering, with a focus on maths and its related subjects. I’m also really interested in music and the arts, and I play piano and draw in my spare time. I would like to learn more about how to use programming, machine learning and data science in research.

Mónica:
Hi! I am a second year BASc student, majoring in societies and minoring in health and environment. I essentially focus on world politics, ethics and social psychology. Out of the academic scope, my personal hobbies include photography and reading, and I love running. I am interested in data science for its relevance in social sciences and for the useful skills I can acquire through this module. 


Julie:
I am majoring in Cultures and am deeply interested in languages and human cultures, focusing on Linguistics and Anthropology in my studies. I am invested in all forms of art and would love to explore the ways in which data science and analysis can teach us about cultural landscapes of modern and past societies.
